## YoungInnovations Internship Challenge 

**Please read the following instructions very carefully while working on the problem.**

Thank you for your interest in interning with us at YoungInnovations. 

Here are the list of the internship challenges. Please choose one of the following specialism areas below and complete the challenge. Pick the area in which you feel you are strongest and most accomplished.

* [Backend Programming](programming/log-processor)
* [Mobile App Development](android/list-me)
* [Frontend](https://github.com/younginnovations/internship-challenges/tree/master/front-end/slush-that)

After the completion of the challenge, please submit your application from [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAZV8uZKjy2B7kafzXxwHZvnM-sG1vWWp8Og0ol081hl6xaQ/viewform). The submission of multiple incomplete or poor solutions will weaken your application. 

If you are able to complete the task fully, and the work is of good quality, we will progress you to the next round of the internship application process.

If we find that an applicant has copied from someone (who has also submitted an application through the challenge), both applicants will be disqualified. At YIPL, we believe in honesty and hard work, and most of all, in the power of learning.

Good luck!
